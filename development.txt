Dev notes, challanges, and ideas:

  Data augmentation:
    - Feature ablation
    - If no positional index, horizontal flip of coords and orientations
    - If no positional index, operate on two climb parts separately and add difficulty predictions together
      (could be used to identify whether model pays attention to the easiest path... like if you take out an unnecessary hold, does it make it harder?)
