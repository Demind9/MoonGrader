# MoonGrader

A GNN that automatically grades Moonboard climbs.

Original GCN architecture is Batched_GNN 3 and 4.  After, I switched to a graph attention network and saw some better results.

I have run into a pretty hard wall around 63% (exact) testing accuracy and am currently experimenting with ways to increase generalization of the model.
